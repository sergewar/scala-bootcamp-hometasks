  // Add additional 2D shapes such as triangle and square.
  //

  // In addition to the 2D shapes classes, add also 3D shapes classes
  // (origin, point, sphere, cube, cuboid, 3D triangle - you can add
  // others if you think they are a good fit).
  //
  // Add method `area` to 2D shapes.
  //
  // Add methods `surfaceArea` and `volume` to 3D shapes.
  //
  // If some of the implementation involves advanced math, it is OK
  // to skip it (leave unimplemented), the primary intent of this
  // exercise is modelling using case classes and traits, and not
